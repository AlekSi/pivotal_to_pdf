This is a gem that can read a story from pivotal tracker and print into a 4x6 card so that you can print the card and stick to your physical story board.

==USAGE
First you need to create a .pivotal.yml under your home directory. No idea how you do this under Windows so no support to Windows yet

a sample .pivotal.yml:

token: your-api-token-of-pivotal-tracker
project_id: your-ptroject-id

After install the gem, type pivotal_to_pdf your-story-id

The gem will then read the story and print it into a PDF
